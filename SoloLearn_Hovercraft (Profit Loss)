# You run a hovercraft factory. Your factory makes ten hovercrafts in a month. Given the number of customers you got that
# month, did you make a profit? It costs you 2,000,000 to build a hovercraft, and you are selling them for 3,000,000. You also
# pay 1,000,000 each month for insurance.
# Task:
# Determine whether or not you made a profit based on how many of the ten hovercrafts you were able to sell that month.
# Input Format:
# An integer that represents the sales that you made that month.
# Output Format:
# A string that says 'Profit', 'Loss', or 'Broke Even'.
