# FUNCTIONS
# a collection of code that performs a specific task

# create a function that greets the user
def say_hi(name, age): #def to begin function development, same of the function and then add ():, the () can include parameters
    print("Hello " + name + " you are " + age)

# def [name of function](function parameters):
    # what the function does when called

# to execute a function it must be called
# functions can be given information, called parameters
# when a function is called, all the code within a function is executed
# a function input can be a mix of both strings and integers, however the print statement in the function will have to convert the integer into a string by using str(parameter)
say_hi("Mike", "35")
say_hi("Steve", "70")
