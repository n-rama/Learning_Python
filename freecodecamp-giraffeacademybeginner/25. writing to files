# WRITING TO FILES

# appending adds to the end of the file

employee_file.close()

# add a variable on a new line

employee_file.write("\ntest 6")  # use the escape character for a new line (\n) for a new line
employee_file.close()


# writing overwrites the whole file

employee_file2.close()


# create a new file
employee_file2 = open("25.a employees1", "w")  # the open file name is a new name, therefore a new file will be created

# different file types can be created as new files
#  xx = open("yy.filetype", "w")  # files types can be txt, HTML, and others
#  xx.write("<p>This is HTML<\p>")  # HTML example. THis is how websites are created in Python
