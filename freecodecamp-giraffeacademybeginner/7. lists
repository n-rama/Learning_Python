# LISTS

# give the list a descriptive name
# lists are stored in square brackets
# strings, numbers, and boolean can be stored in a list
friends = ["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim", "Oscar", "Toby"]

#modifying the list after it has been created
friends[1] = "Mike"

# how to access the list and items in the list
# list indexes begin from 0
print(friends)
print(friends[0])  # returns index result
print(friends[-1])  # returns index starting at the end of the list, note how it begins at -1 in reverse
print(friends[1:])  # returns result of the index and all results after
print(friends[1:3])  # returns range of results, note it does not return the result at the last index number
