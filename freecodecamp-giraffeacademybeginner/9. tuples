# TUPLES
# type of data structure that can store different values
# tuples are stored in ()
# tuples are immutable, i.e., they cannot be changed

coordinates = (4, 5)
print(coordinates)

# data within a tuple can be accessed in a similar way to a list
print(coordinates[0])  # [] to return an element based on the index value

# a list of tuples can be created
coordinates2 = [(1, 2), (3, 4)]
print(coordinates2)
print(coordinates2[0])
print(coordinates2[-1])
