# TRY EXCEPT
# helps to catch errors in code

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # if an integer is not entered, the code will return an error
print(number)

# with try, the code can be tested and if there is an error it will do something else, similar to IFERROR in Excel
try:  # test original code
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(number)
except:  # iferror then do this,
    print("Invalid input")

# except only specific errors, this can be useful to return different results for certain errors
try:
    value = 10 / 0
    number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(number)
except ZeroDivisionError as err:  # as to store the error as a variable
    print(err)
except ValueError:
    print("invalid input")
