# FOR LOOP

for letter in "Giraffe Academy":  # for every letter [variable] in Giraffe Academy [string], do something. Specify a variable that represents a different value in each loop
    print(letter) # this will print each letter of Giraffe Academy in turn

# for loops also work with arrays
friends = ["Jim", "Karen", "Kevin"]
for friend in friends:  # friend is a new variable that defines each element of the array
    print(friend)

# the range to loop can be defined in the for loop structure
for index in range(10):
    print(index)  # this will print 0-9

# a range of numbers can also be specified
for index1 in range(3, 10):
    print(index1)  # this will print 3-9

# loop through a previously defined range with the len function
for index2 in range(len(friends)):
    print(friends[index2])  # note how the range has to be included in the print statement. This will print the names of the friends

# additional logic can be applied within a for loop
for index in range(5):
    if index == 0:
        print("first iteration")  # this will be printed on the first iteration
    else:
        print("not first iteration")  # this will be printed on all subsequent iterations
