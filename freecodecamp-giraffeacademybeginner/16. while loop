# WHILE LOOP
# allows to execute a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is false

i = 1  # create an integer
while i<=10:  # the code will continue to execute if this condition is true and stop when this condition is false
    print (i)
    i += 1  # shorthand for i = i + 1

print ("Done with loop")
